Roofs:
	Drawn onto the world Surface last.  This layer is on top of all other layers.

Buildings:
	Drawn onto the world Surface after moving objects.  Objects can pass under this layer.
	
Players / NPCs / Objects:
	These objects can move around, drawn on top of terrain (which is basically the floor)
	
Terrain
	This layer is drawn under everything else.
	
When these things are loaded in order Terrain > Players > Buildings > Roofs
it creates an illusion of a 2 dimensional world.

Maps are created in Tiled map editor, where the layers look similar.
Layers have to be input to Tiled this way for map.py to load the json files correctly.

Layer 1 in tiled: Terrain (TILE LAYER) (tiles that get walked on)
	These tiles are simply loaded into a list and get displayed graphically.
Layer 2 in tiled: Collisions (OBJECT LAYER)
	This layer can be made by using the Rectangle tool to draw where the player will collide.
	The rectangles drawn in Tiled eventually get converted to pygame.Rect objects that are checked
	in a collidelist() to see if the player runs into them.
Layer 3 in tiled: Walls (TILE LAYER)
	This layer is also just displayed graphically, but is displayed on top of other tiles.
Layer 4 in tiled: Roofs (TILE LAYER)
	This layer is displayed on top of ALL other tiles.
