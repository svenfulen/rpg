When a key is pressed, the handler checks:
1. Map bounds.
2. Collisions (Done with map helper function)
3. If the player object is allowed to move in the given direction.

Collisions are handled by a pygame.collidelist() and 4 rects surrounding the player.
For example, if a rect in collidelist() collides with the player's LEFT rect,
the player will not be allowed to move left.
In this case, the player is free to move right, up, or down.
Once the player moves to the RIGHT, the player will be allowed to move left again.
